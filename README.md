# Calssification of colored path graphs with 4 vertices.

This repository contains the following files:

1. P4Graphs.m2: Using Macaulay 2 codes (see https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1466943) to generates the vanishing ideal of all 44 possible coloring of path graphs with 4 vertices, and return the list of generators in LaTeX format.
2. Macaulay_to_Sage.ipynb: Python codes that translate the Macaulay2 output from the previous codes into a proper input for SageMath.
3. ToricCasesP4.ipy: incorporates code from [villjulian/isToric](https://github.com/villjulian/isToric), this file showed all of the path graph examples with 4 vertices which are toric after the change of variables.
